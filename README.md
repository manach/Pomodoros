Chris Scott's Pomodoros

This is just a way to play around with the command line.
And it makes me feel like a REAL LIVE PROGRAMMER to do these myself instead of using a web app.

setpom.sh: the main file; symlinked to /usr/local/bin/setpom on my machine so that whenever I make changes,
  they're reflected in what ends up being the 'setpom' command.
simple-pom.sh: the first one, copied from Gabriel Bezerra (who in turn based)
  his version on Philippe Creux's Ruby version).
user-pom.sh: the first one with user input.
